# Stock Market Price Prediction using Multiple Linear Regression. (2023)
## Introduction 
Stock market is a marketplace where investors buy and sell stocks. As a platform of continuous stock exchanges, the stock market provides companies the opportunity to raise their capital and investors to gain profits from their investments. The stock values are impacted by various factors including news articles, public sentiment, changes in the market flow, political situation, and other unforeseen incidents. As the future is inherently unpredictable, predicting the future value of the stock market remains challenging. Given that, the high sensitivity and randomness of the market cause investors to face difficulty in making profit-worthy decisions.   
The pivotal focus of this project is to solve the following problem: investors encountering a high risk of facing losses from their investments, due to the volatility of the stock market. With the usage of a machine learning technique, this project aims to make predictions of the future values of the stock market, using large-scale datasets of past multiyear stock markets. The importance of building a predictive model of the stock market lies in identifying the patterns and trends of the stock market. Accordingly, investors are expected to be advantaged by making informed decisions that maximize profit from a wiser investment. 

## Method 
### Data Preprocessing 

## Evaluation 
As a measurement of accuracy, Root Mean Squared Error(RMSE) was chosen. RMSE is the average distance between the predicted value from the model and the actual value recorded in the dataset (Zach, 2021). Hence, RMSE provides a reliable indication of the fitness of the model. That is, a model with a low RMSE value suggests that the model can make predictions with high accuracy. Conversely, a high RMSE value implies that the model fails to make accurate predictions.
